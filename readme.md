# V3 Jekyll

Not much to see here yet. So far just a collection of The Good Partsâ„¢ of the current Richland Library web site, refactored, cleaned up with new standards. Documentation follows below:

## Human-Readable Color Palette

## SVG UI on a 12-Square Grid
The icon grid (12 units) was adopted from FontAwesome so icons from that set are compatible, but only the necessary icons have been included. The icomoon configuration can be found at [/img/ui/Richland Library 2.0.json].
